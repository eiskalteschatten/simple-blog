# simple-blog

This idea behind this proof-of-concept is to create a frameworkless, extremely simple blog that requires no building and no dependencies other than a basic installation of PHP and a web server such as Apache.

It is based on a similar proof-of-concept project I created called [simple-frameworkless-website](https://github.com/eiskalteschatten/simple-frameworkless-website).

## Commands

Run the local development server:

```
php -S localhost:8000
```
